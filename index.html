		<h2>welcome to Archived Legacies</h2>
		<h3>My name is Ace, and im the creator of every character you see here. Im making this so I can log and Share my creations for everyone to see!</h3>
  <h3>This is mainly a small mini project, ill probably only update it whenever I make a new character or something, IDK. My only wish is that you enjoy looking at my OCs. And dont steal.</h3>

		<h2>What are the navigation buttons above?</h2>
		<h3>The navigation buttons lead to their respective pages; Home leads to the Home Page, which is where you can see all the changes or additions, Charactes leads to the characters page, where you can see characters ive made or ones that <strong>you</strong> have made and submitted on the discord server, and so on (you should get it). However, Home and Characters are the only buttons that have a page right now, but they are coming soon!! Such is the discord server.</h3>
