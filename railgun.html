				<h2> Backstory & Origin </h2>
                <p><strong>Pre-Superhero Life:</strong> Maddox was born into a fairly wealthy family. Yet this wealthy childhood brought a price; Abuse. He was always abused, ignored, starved. After it got worse when he came out as gay when he was 13 he ran away, and was found by Kelly and Charles Loris.
Charles was later killed when Maddox was 16, however, causing Maddox to plummet into severe depression for 4 years, getting into alcohol and drugs. After he got Kelly killed too however, he became suicidal. Right before ending his life, he discovered his powers.
</p>
                <p><strong> What was their life like before becoming a hero? Family, friends, and upbringing?:</strong> His family, despite being considered wealthy and rich, was extremely abusive and homophobic. At 13, when he came out to his family, he was beaten. So he ran away. His parents never searched for him, but he was found by Kelly and Charles Loris.</p>
                <p><strong>Turning Point:</strong> After discovering his abilities before ending his life, he remembered how he was abused. Not wanting people to go through the same thing he did, he decides give life a second chance and become a superhero.</p>
				<p><strong>What event or incident led them to becoming a superhero?</strong>His abusive past gave him a sense of injustice and wants to protect others from going through the pain he did.</p>
				<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> The thought of his adoptive parents, and the knowledge he can protect others. </p>
				<p><strong>What drives them to fight for justice? Is it revenge, redemption, duty, or something else?</strong> At first, it was revenge. But he shortly came to the realization revenge is the worst reason to be a superhero. So instead, his drive to stand up and continue fighting is the knowledge that he can make people’s lives better</p>
				<p><strong>Discovery of Powers/Abilities:</strong> He was looking down at the road, 27 stories below. He was going to throw himself off the building. He had enough of life; The abuse he went through and his adoptive parents dying. All of it broke him. He felt the air on his face as he fell, feeling as if time was moving in slow motion. No second thoughts. He wanted to die. Just before he reached the ground, he felt himself come to an abrupt stop. He opened his eyes. He was levitating just 5 feet from the ground. </p>
				<p><strong>How did they gain their powers or skills? Was it an accident, experiment, or inheritance?</strong> Unknown. He just has them. He theorizes it may be from a school accident; It was a science fair that failed and caused the school to be destroyed. Nobody died except the kid who made the experiment.</p>
